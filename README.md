# Incremental-Sheet-Forming-of-Perforated-SS-sheets
Finite element analysis of single point incremental sheet forming (SPIF) of perforated SS304L using Abaqus CAE. The study evaluates the influence of feed rate, step depth, and tool speed on contact force, stress distribution, strain behaviour, and thickness variation to guide experiments.
